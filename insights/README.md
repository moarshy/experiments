# Data Insights Generator (v3)

## Overview

The Data Insights Generator (v3) is an advanced data analysis and insights generation system that utilizes a multi-agent architecture powered by large language models (LLMs). This system aims to derive a broad range of meaningful insights and actionable recommendations from datasets by first understanding the data through a dedicated summary agent, then proactively generating and exploring numerous potential questions. It leverages LLMs to analyze data from multiple perspectives and synthesize observations into comprehensive reports.

## Architecture

The system follows a multi-agent analysis pipeline:

### 1. Database Summary Agent
- Takes information about the database connection and the specific table(s) relevant to the user's query
- Analyzes the schema and potentially samples the data
- Generates a concise summary of the data's structure, key characteristics, and baseline statistics (e.g., averages, distributions)
- Provides context for later stages

### 2. Question Generating Agent
- Takes the user's initial query and the summary of the database from the Database Summary Agent as input
- Generates a multitude of potential analysis questions (potentially hundreds through iterative looping)
- Explores different facets of the data, guided by the initial query and data characteristics

### 3. Text2SQL Agent
- Receives a generated question
- Translates it into a corresponding SQL query suitable for execution against the data
- Includes validation steps to enhance accuracy

### 4. Execute SQL Agent
- Executes the validated SQL query generated by the Text2SQL agent
- Retrieves the resulting data (either a single answer or a table)
- Handles potential execution errors

### 5. Insight Agent
Takes the following as input:
- Original user query
- Generated question
- Executed SQL query
- Resulting data
- Context from the Database Summary Agent

Capabilities:
- Applies Analytical Logic: Performs comparisons against historical data, benchmarks, or different segments within the results
- Utilizes Basic Statistics: Identifies potential anomalies, calculates significance, and detects simple trends or patterns

Generates Structured Insights with:
- `insight_tier`: Categorizing the insight's depth (e.g., Observation, Comparison, Significance, Pattern, Contribution)
- `headline`: A concise summary
- `description`: Detailed explanation and context
- `supporting_data`: Key evidence from the results
- `comparison_point`: Relevant benchmark or historical data
- `significance_metric`: Statistical context if calculated

### 6. Insight Consolidation Agent
Aggregates and processes the structured insights by:
- **Deduplication**: Identifies and merges semantically similar insights
- **Prioritization**: Ranks insights based on:
  - Relevance to the original query
  - Significance (using insight_tier and metrics)
  - Potential novelty
- **Synthesis**: Combines multiple related lower-tier insights into broader, more comprehensive higher-level findings or narratives
- **Categorization/Grouping**: Organizes insights logically for reporting

### 7. Report Generating Agent
- Takes consolidated, prioritized, and synthesized insights
- Formats them into a comprehensive and user-friendly report
- May include:
  - Structured text
  - Suggested visualizations based on insight type
  - Carefully framed actionable recommendations
  - Areas for further investigation

## Key Components

### Insights Agent (Multi-Agent System)

The core system consists of specialized agents:
1. **Database Summary Agent**: Analyzes and summarizes database schema and content
2. **Question Generating Agent**: Proactively explores data through question generation
3. **Text2SQL Agent**: Translates natural language questions into validated SQL queries
4. **Execute SQL Agent**: Interacts with data source to execute queries and handle errors
5. **Insight Agent**: Generates structured insights by applying analytical and statistical logic
6. **Insight Consolidation Agent**: Organizes, deduplicates, prioritizes, and synthesizes generated insights
7. **Report Generating Agent**: Formats and presents the final insights report

The revised version explicitly incorporates the need for deeper analysis within the Insight Agent and clarifies the role of the Insight Consolidation Agent in handling and refining insights based on their defined depth and relevance.
