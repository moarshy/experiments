Agent Card: Report Generating Agent (v2.0 - LLM Powered)
Agent Name:
Report Generating Agent (LLM Powered)
Version:
v2.0
Core Objective:
To generate a comprehensive, narrative-driven, human-readable report in Markdown format by prompting an LLM with the final consolidated insights, relevant context (original query, DB summary), and a desired report structure outline.
Key Features & Capabilities:
LLM-Powered Generation: Leverages an LLM to synthesize the provided insights and context into a coherent report narrative, including summaries, transitions, and interpretations.
Structured Insight Input: Takes the prioritized and deduplicated list of StructuredInsight objects as the primary source material.
Contextual Awareness: Incorporates the original_user_query and database_summary into the prompt to provide overall context for the report.
Structure Guidance: Uses a user-provided or default report_structure_prompt (a string outlining desired sections like Title, Summary, Key Insights, etc.) to guide the LLM's output structure.
Audience Adaptation (via Prompting): Instructs the LLM within the prompt to tailor the report's tone, language, and level of detail for the specified target_audience (e.g., 'executive').
Markdown Output: Directly requests and outputs the final report in Markdown format.
Insight Summarization & Integration: Relies on the LLM to select, summarize, and integrate information from the various fields of the provided StructuredInsight objects (headline, description, metrics, actions, questions) into the relevant sections of the report narrative.
Inputs:
consolidated_insights: List[StructuredInsight] - The final, prioritized list of insights. (Potentially truncated to Top-N for prompt length).
original_user_query: Optional[str] - For report context.
database_summary: Optional[DatabaseSummary] - For report context.
report_structure_prompt: str - A string outlining the desired sections and potentially their order (e.g., "Title\nExecutive Summary\nKey Findings\nRecommendations\nFurther Investigation").
target_audience: str (Default: 'executive') - To guide LLM tone and detail.
(Configuration) Parameters controlling how many insights are passed to the LLM.
(Implicit) LLM Client & Configuration (e.g., model, temperature).
Outputs:
report_markdown: str - The LLM-generated report content in Markdown format.
Key Design Principles:
Generative First: Relies primarily on the LLM's generative capabilities for report writing and structuring based on instructions.
Prompt Engineering is Key: The quality and relevance of the generated report heavily depend on the clarity, detail, and structure of the prompt provided to the LLM.
Structure-Guided Generation: Uses the report_structure_prompt to ensure the LLM covers the necessary topics in a logical order.
Simplified Agent Logic: The agent code focuses mainly on preparing inputs, constructing the detailed prompt, and interacting with the LLM, rather than complex formatting logic.
Potential Future Enhancements:
Support for more output formats (requiring specific LLM prompting or post-processing).
More sophisticated handling of large numbers of insights (e.g., multi-stage prompting, recursive summarization before final report generation).
Fact-checking or validating LLM-generated summaries against the source StructuredInsight data.
Allowing more complex template formats beyond a simple structure outline.
Iterative report refinement based on LLM self-critique or user feedback.
Adding LLM-generated visualization suggestions or even code snippets (e.g., matplotlib, plotly).
