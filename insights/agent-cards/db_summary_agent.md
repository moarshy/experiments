Agent Card: Database Summary Agent (v1.0)

Agent Name:
- Database Summary Agent

Version:
- v1.0

Core Objective:
- To connect to a specified database, systematically analyze its schema structure and content statistics, and generate both a detailed, structured technical summary and a concise, human-readable natural language summary. This provides foundational context for subsequent data analysis agents.

Key Features & Capabilities:
- Database Connectivity: Connects to SQLite databases (as per provided code).
- Schema Discovery: Identifies tables, columns, data types, primary keys, and foreign key relationships (PRAGMA table_info, PRAGMA foreign_key_list).
- Column Profiling: For each column, determines nullability, uniqueness, distinct value count, NULL value count/percentage, and extracts sample values.
- Statistical Analysis: Calculates basic statistics for relevant columns (Min, Max, Avg for numeric/date types).
- Distribution Analysis: Determines the value distribution for categorical columns with a low number of unique values (configurable threshold).
- Table Metrics: Calculates the total row count for each table.
- Temporal Data Detection: Identifies tables containing date/time columns and determines the min/max date range.
- Relationship Mapping: Explicitly lists detected foreign key relationships between tables.
- Structured Output: Generates a detailed technical summary using Pydantic models (DatabaseSummary, TableSummary, ColumnSummary).
- Natural Language Synthesis: Leverages an LLM (OpenAI specified in code) to translate the technical summary into an understandable narrative summary, highlighting key characteristics for analysis.
- Connection Management: Handles database connection opening and closing.

Inputs:
- db_path: String - Path to the SQLite database file.
(Configuration) unique_value_threshold: Integer - The maximum number of unique values in a column to perform full distribution analysis.
(Implicit) LLM API Access/Configuration: Credentials and settings for the LLM used for natural language summary generation.
Outputs:

A Python dictionary containing:
- technical_summary: A dictionary representation of the DatabaseSummary Pydantic model, detailing tables, columns, statistics, and relationships.
- natural_language_summary: A string containing the LLM-generated descriptive summary of the database.
Key Design Principles:
- Metadata-Driven: Relies heavily on database metadata (PRAGMA statements) and statistical aggregates (COUNT, MIN, MAX, AVG).
- Comprehensive Overview: Aims to provide a holistic picture of the database structure and content at a summary level.
- Dual Output: Provides both machine-readable structured data and human-readable text for different downstream uses.
- Efficiency: Uses targeted SQL queries to gather statistics without loading entire datasets (where possible).
- Modularity: Functions as a distinct, initial step in the data analysis pipeline.

Potential Future Enhancements:
- Support for additional database systems (PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQL Server, etc.).
- More advanced statistical measures (standard deviation, percentiles, median).
- Enhanced data type detection and handling.
- Data quality checks (e.g., identifying potential outliers, mixed types).
- Configurable data sampling strategies for large tables.
- Ability to focus analysis on specific schemas or tables within a larger database.
- Support for different LLM providers for summary generation.
