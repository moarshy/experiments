Agent Card: Insight Agent (v1.0)
Agent Name:
- Insight Agent
Version:
- v1.0

Core Objective:
- To analyze the results of a single, specific query execution (ProcessedQuestionResult), interpret the data within the context of the original question asked and the overall database summary, and generate one or more structured, meaningful insights (StructuredInsight) that highlight non-obvious findings, comparisons, trends, or anomalies present within that result set.

Key Features & Capabilities:
- LLM-Powered Analysis: Leverages a Large Language Model for data interpretation, pattern recognition, and insight generation.
- Contextual Interpretation: Analyzes the execution_data from a ProcessedQuestionResult specifically in relation to the question_text that prompted the query.
- Utilizes Database Summary: Uses the DatabaseSummary for broader context, schema understanding, and potential comparison against - overall statistics (e.g., averages, ranges).

Identifies Findings within Results: Detects:
- Internal Comparisons: Differences between segments/groups present in the results.
- Basic Trends: Simple patterns over time if time-series data is present in the results.
- Relative Anomalies: Significant deviations within the result set compared to other data points in the same set or summary statistics.
- Contributions: Key drivers or segments within the results.
- Relationships: Potential correlations between metrics observed in the results.
- Handles Execution Outcomes: Generates specific StructuredInsight objects indicating query failures or empty result sets.
Structured Output: Produces a list of StructuredInsight objects, each containing fields like headline, description, tier (Observation, Comparison, Trend, Anomaly, etc.), supporting_metrics, estimated scores, and suggested next steps.
- Heuristic Scoring: The LLM provides estimated scores for relevance, significance, and confidence.
- Suggests Next Steps: Generates potential business actions and follow-up analytical questions based on the insight.
- Data Summarization: Employs strategies (e.g., statistics, sampling) to summarize potentially large execution_data before sending it to the LLM.

Inputs:
- processed_question_result: A ProcessedQuestionResult object containing the specific question, the generated SQL, and the results (data, errors, metadata) of its execution.
- database_summary: A DatabaseSummary object providing overall database context (schema, statistics, relationships, NL summary).
- original_user_query: Optional[str] - The initial high-level query from the user, used primarily for relevance assessment.
- (Implicit) LLM API Access & Configuration.

Outputs:
- List[StructuredInsight]: A list containing zero or more StructuredInsight Pydantic objects derived from the analysis of the single input ProcessedQuestionResult.

Key Design Principles:
- LLM-Centric: Core analysis and generation capabilities rely on prompting an LLM.
- Single Query Focus: Each run analyzes the results pertaining to only one executed query. Aggregation happens later.
- Context is Crucial: Interpretation quality depends heavily on the provided question and database summary context.
- Structured & Interpretable Output: Emphasizes a consistent, detailed format for insights using the StructuredInsight model.
- Handles Edge Cases: Explicitly designed to produce output even for query failures or empty datasets.
- Bounded Analysis Scope: Primarily analyzes patterns, comparisons, and anomalies within the provided execution_data or against - pre-calculated database summary statistics. It does not independently query for historical data or external benchmarks.

Potential Future Enhancements:
- Integration of more sophisticated statistical analysis (e.g., using Python libraries pre-LLM call) to supplement LLM interpretation.
- Ability to incorporate external benchmark data if provided.
- Mechanisms to trigger targeted follow-up queries based on initial findings (would require architectural changes).
- More robust detection and reporting of data quality issues within the results.
- Fine-tuning the underlying LLM for specific business domains or insight types.
- Implementing more deterministic methods for calculating relevance/significance scores.
- Adding user feedback mechanisms to improve insight quality over time.
