Agent Card: Insight Consolidation Agent (v2.0 - Advanced Synthesis)
Agent Name:
- Insight Consolidation Agent (Advanced Synthesis)
Version:
- v2.0

Core Objective:
- To process the raw collection of StructuredInsight objects, performing not only deduplication and prioritization but also sophisticated multi-level synthesis and abstraction. The goal is to identify hierarchical relationships and overarching themes, generating concise, high-level strategic insights suitable for executive reporting, in addition to refining the initial findings.

Key Features & Capabilities:
- Insight Aggregation: Collects and manages the pool of all generated StructuredInsight objects.
- Semantic Deduplication: Identifies and merges semantically similar insights using embeddings and similarity metrics.
- Multi-Factor Prioritization: Ranks unique insights based on relevance, significance, confidence, tier, and potentially novelty or actionability.
- Advanced Insight Synthesis (LLM-Powered Core Enhancement):
- Hierarchical Synthesis: Identifies related insights at different granularities (e.g., product-level, regional-level) and synthesizes them iteratively into broader, multi-level findings (e.g., overall business unit performance derived from regional summaries).
- Thematic Abstraction: Moves beyond direct summarization to identify higher-order themes, strategic implications, or underlying causal hypotheses suggested by clusters of related insights (e.g., synthesizing findings about specific product sales into an insight about shifting market preferences).
- Relationship Analysis: Attempts to identify and articulate complex relationships (e.g., correlations, potential drivers) between different synthesized or individual insights.
- Nuance Handling: Aims to incorporate potentially complementary or mildly conflicting details during synthesis to provide a more complete picture.
- Filtering & Selection: Removes lower-priority insights or intermediate synthesis steps based on ranking scores and configuration, ensuring the final output is focused and high-value.
- (Optional) Categorization: Groups the final insights based on synthesized themes, business areas, or other relevant dimensions.

Inputs:
- insights_list: List[StructuredInsight] - The raw collection of insights.
- original_user_query: Optional[str] - Reference for relevance scoring.
- database_summary: Optional[DatabaseSummary] - Provides broader context that might aid abstraction.
- (Configuration) Enhanced parameters controlling:
    - Deduplication thresholds.
    - Prioritization weights.
    - Synthesis depth/levels.
    - Abstraction strategy/aggressiveness.
    - Thematic clustering parameters.
    - Filtering thresholds/limits.
    - (Implicit) Access to embedding models.
    - (Implicit) Access to advanced LLM API & Configuration (potentially requiring stronger reasoning capabilities).

Outputs:
    - refined_insights_list: List[StructuredInsight] - The final list, including sophisticated, synthesized, and abstracted insights, ordered by priority.
    - (Optional) categorized_insights: Dict[str, List[StructuredInsight]] - Refined insights organized by derived themes or categories.
    - (Potentially) synthesis_graph: Data structure representing the hierarchical relationships between raw insights and synthesized ones (for traceability).

Key Design Principles:
    - Abstraction & Summarization: Focuses on moving up the "information ladder" from specific data points to strategic themes.
    - Hierarchical Processing: Explicitly designed to handle relationships and synthesis across multiple levels of detail.
    - Advanced LLM Reasoning: Relies heavily on the sophisticated reasoning, summarization, and abstraction capabilities of LLMs.
    - Semantic Understanding: Goes beyond keyword matching to understand the underlying meaning and relationships between insights.
    - Configurability: Allows tuning the depth and nature of the synthesis and abstraction process.
    - Traceability (Goal): Ideally, synthesized insights should retain links back to the source insights they were derived from (potentially via the synthesis_graph output).

Potential Future Enhancements (Building on v2.0):
- Integration with knowledge graphs for richer contextual understanding and validation during synthesis.
- Explicit causal inference modeling based on synthesized relationships.
- Generation of predictive insights based on abstracted trends and themes.
- Automated identification and reconciliation of contradictory insights during synthesis.
- Techniques to ensure factual grounding and mitigate LLM hallucination during high-level abstraction.
- Interactive exploration of the synthesis hierarchy by the user.
