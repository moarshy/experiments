Agent Card: Combined Text2SQL and Execute SQL Agent (Vanna AI) (v1.0)

Agent Name:
- Combined Text2SQL and Execute SQL Agent (Vanna AI)

Version:
v1.0

Core Objective:
- To accurately translate natural language analytical questions into executable SQL queries using the Vanna AI framework, execute these queries against the target database, handle potential errors, and return the structured data results along with relevant execution metadata.

Key Features & Capabilities:
- Natural Language to SQL: Translates user questions (likely generated by the Question Generating Agent) into SQL queries.
- Schema-Aware Translation: Leverages database schema information (DDL, potentially documentation, sample queries) during the translation process, managed via Vanna's training/RAG mechanisms.
- Vanna AI Integration: Utilizes the Vanna AI library/approach for Text-to-SQL, potentially involving training, fine-tuning, or Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).
- Vector DB Integration (ChromaDB): Uses ChromaDB (as mentioned in the overview) likely for storing embeddings of schema/metadata to support Vanna's RAG process.
- LLM Integration: Employs LLMs as part of the Vanna framework for the core translation task.
- SQL Execution: Connects to the database and executes the generated SQL query.
- Result Retrieval & Structuring: Fetches the data resulting from the query execution and presents it in a structured format.
- Error Handling: Captures and reports errors encountered during SQL execution (e.g., syntax errors, access issues).
- Performance Monitoring: Provides execution metrics (e.g., query execution time, rows returned).

Inputs:
- question: String - The natural language analytical question to be translated and executed.
- Database Connection Details: Information required to connect to the target data source (e.g., connection string, credentials).
- Vanna AI Training Data/Configuration: Database schema (DDL), potentially documentation, sample SQL queries, and other artifacts used to train or configure the Vanna instance for the specific database.
- (Implicit) Access to configured LLMs used by Vanna.
- (Implicit) Access to the configured ChromaDB instance.

Outputs:
- A structured response containing:
    - executed_sql_query: String - The SQL query that was generated and executed.
    - resulting_data: Structured data (e.g., list of dictionaries, Pandas DataFrame) returned by the query.
    - performance_metrics: Dictionary - Information such as execution time, number of rows returned.
    - error_message: String (Optional) - Detailed error message if query execution failed.
    - status: String - Indication of success or failure.

Key Design Principles:
- Accuracy: Prioritizes generating correct and executable SQL that accurately reflects the intent of the natural language question.
- Framework Reliance: Leverages the capabilities and specific methodology of the Vanna AI library.
- Contextualization: Uses database schema and related information to inform the translation process.
- Automation: Automates the process of querying data based on natural language input.
- Robustness: Incorporates error handling for the SQL execution phase.

Potential Future Enhancements:
- Support for generating more complex SQL (e.g., advanced window functions, CTEs, procedural SQL if applicable).
- Pre-execution SQL validation/linting.
- Query optimization capabilities or suggestions.
- Caching mechanisms for frequently asked questions/queries.
- Interactive clarification loop for ambiguous questions.
- Support for database dialects beyond the initial Vanna setup.
- Tighter integration with visualization suggestions based on query results.
